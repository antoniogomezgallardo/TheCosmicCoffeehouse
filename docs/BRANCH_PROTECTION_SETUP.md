# Branch Protection Configuration Guide

## GitHub Branch Protection Setup

To prevent direct commits to `main` and `develop` branches, configure these protection rules in your GitHub repository:

### Repository Settings Path
1. Go to: **Repository** → **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Click **Add rule** for each branch

### Protection Rules for `main` Branch

#### Basic Settings:
- ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB**
- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - ✅ Require approvals: **1**
  - ✅ Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
  - ✅ Require review from code owners
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Add status checks: `test`, `lint`, `build` (when CI/CD is implemented)
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- ✅ **Include administrators** (enforces rules for repo admins too)
- ✅ **Allow force pushes: Everyone** (disabled)
- ✅ **Allow deletions** (disabled)

### Protection Rules for `develop` Branch

#### Basic Settings:
- ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB**
- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - ✅ Require approvals: **1**
  - ✅ Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Add status checks: `test`, `lint` (when CI/CD is implemented)
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- ✅ **Include administrators** (enforces rules for repo admins too)
- ✅ **Allow force pushes: Everyone** (disabled)
- ✅ **Allow deletions** (disabled)

## GitFlow Workflow with Branch Protection

### Development Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Always start from updated develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Develop and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement your feature"

# 4. Push feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# - From: feature/your-feature-name
# - To: develop
# - Get approval and merge

# 6. Clean up
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
```

### Release Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.x.x

# 2. Update version numbers and finalize
git commit -m "release: bump version to v1.x.x"

# 3. Create PR to main
# - From: release/v1.x.x
# - To: main
# - Get approval and merge

# 4. Tag the release
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.x.x -m "Release v1.x.x"
git push origin v1.x.x

# 5. Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```

## Benefits of Branch Protection

### Security & Quality:
- ✅ Prevents accidental direct commits to main/develop
- ✅ Ensures code review process
- ✅ Maintains clean Git history
- ✅ Requires status checks (tests, linting)

### QA Engineering Demonstration:
- ✅ Shows enterprise-grade development practices
- ✅ Demonstrates quality gates implementation
- ✅ Enforces peer review culture
- ✅ Supports continuous integration workflows

## Quick Setup Commands

Once branch protection is enabled, use these commands for all development:

```bash
# Never commit directly to main/develop
git checkout main    # ❌ This will be protected
git commit -m "..."  # ❌ Will be rejected

# Always use feature branches
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature  # ✅ Correct approach
git commit -m "feat: add feature"   # ✅ Safe to commit
git push origin feature/my-feature  # ✅ Push feature branch
# Then create PR on GitHub           # ✅ Merge via PR only
```

## Status

- ✅ **Release v1.1.0**: Successfully created and tagged
- 🔄 **Branch Protection**: Manual setup required (see above)
- 📋 **Next Steps**: Configure protection rules in GitHub Settings

**Note**: Branch protection rules will take effect immediately after configuration. All future commits to `main` and `develop` must go through pull requests.
